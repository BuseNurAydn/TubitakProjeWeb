In our project, which we carried out with teamwork within the scope of the Tubitak 2209-A program, I created a web-based interface using React. An interface has been designed where the patient's information is entered from the form on the information entry page and the information is retrieved and displayed from the patient's information page. According to this information, it is aimed to detect the disease with machine learning studies.
